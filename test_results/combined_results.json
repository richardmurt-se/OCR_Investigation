Certain Older Gas Connectors May Be Dangerous!\nGas connectors are corrugated metal tubes used to connect gas appliances in your home to fuel gas supply pipes. Some older brass connectors have come apart,\ncausing fires and explosions resulting in deaths and injuries. These older brass connectors have a serious flaw in how their tubing was joined to their end pieces. Over\ntime, the end pieces can separate from the tubing and cause a serious gas leak, explosion or fire. To our knowledge, these dangerous uncoated brass connectors\nhave not been made for more than 20 years, but many of them are still in use. The older these connectors get, the greater the possibility of failure. Although not all\nuncoated connectors have this flaw, it is very difficult to tell which ones do. Therefore, any uncoated brass connector should be replaced immediately\nwith either a new plastic-coated brass or a new stainless steel connector. Connectors can wear out from too much moving, bending or corrosion. Connectors should\nalways be replaced whenever the appliance is replaced or moved from its location.\nWARNING: Only a qualified professional should check your connector and replace it if needed. Don't try to do this yourself! Moving the appliance, even slightly,\nwhether to clean behind it or to inspect its gas connector, can cause the complete failure of one of these older weakened connectors, possibly resulting in a deadly fire or explosion.\nDo not move your appliance to check the connector! For additional information on appliance connectors please call us at 888.642.6748 or visit our website at nicorgas.com.\nILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION\nTAXES\nCCF (100 cubic feet) - A measure of the volume of gas\nConsumer Services Div. 800.524.0795\nMunicipal Use Tax - Some municipalities charge this\nused. 1 CCF approximates 1 therm of gas.\nThe Consumer Services Division is available to assist\ntax based on your gas use.

In caso di punto disalimentabile, tramite apposita\ncomunicazione di costituzione in mora, EDISON ENERGIA provvederà ad intimare il pagamento entro 20 giorni solari dalla data di\nemissione della stessa comunicazione (o 10 giorni nel caso in cui la comunicazione di costituzione in mora sia inviata tramite PEC ).\nL'eventuale pagamento dovrà essere\ntempestivamente comunicato tramite numero di fax indicato nella comunicazione stessa .\nDiversamente, decorsi i 20 giorni e con il permanere dello stato di morosità, EDISON ENERGIA avrà il diritto di chiedere, decorsi 3 giorni\ndal termine ultimo di pagamento, al Distributore locale la sospensione della fornitura di energia elettrica. Qualora il CLIENTE sia connesso\nin bassa tensione (BT) e sussistano le condizioni tecniche del misuratore, il Distributore locale prima di procedere alla sospensione della\nfornitura dovrà effettuare una riduzione della potenza ad un livello pari al 15% (quindici per cento) della potenza disponibile.

Il CLIENTE avrà altresì diritto ad un indennizzo automatico di importo pari a 20\n(venti) euro nel caso in cui la fornitura venga sospesa per morosità senza che EDISON ENERGIA abbia garantito al CLIENTE finale il\nrispetto del: a) termine ultimo di pagamento indicato nella comunicazione di costituzione in mora; b) termine massimo previsto\ndall'ARERA tra la data di emissione della comunicazione di costituzione in mora e la data di consegna al vettore postale della stessa; c )\ntermine minimo previsto dall'ARERA tra la data ultima di scadenza di pagamento e la data della richiesta al distributore locale\ndell'intervento di chiusura di riconsegna per sospensione della fornitura per morosità.\nIl Cliente inoltre in caso di ritardato o mancato pagamento delle fatture di fornitura gas o elettrica, indipendentemente dalla costituzione in\nmora, sarà tenuto al pagamento degli interessi di mora calcolati nella misura del Tasso di Mora ex D. Lgs. 231/02 - di volta in volta in\nvigore maturati durante il periodo intercorrente tra la data di inadempimento contrattuale e fino alla data di effettivo pagamento oltre agli\neventuali costi di sospensione e di riattivazione della fornitura nel limite dell'ammontare previsto dall'ARERA.\nEDISON\nFattura N. 5400105322 del 13/11/2018 - Pag. 6 di 6"

Visit www.swgas.com and create a MyAccount to view, manage, and\ncustomize your gas account online, or call our local toll-free number (llamada gratis) at 1-877-860-6020 for billing questions.\nBasic Service Charge - This monthly charge recovers a portion of the cost for delivering natural gas.\nBill Detail - Customers may request a detailed version of their gas bill by accessing My Account or calling 1-877-860-6020.\nBilling Factor - The billing factor is used to convert the metered volume of gas into units of heat energy which are called therms. SWG\nbills customers on a per therm basis for the amount of energy contained in the gas delivered. The current reading minus the previous\nreading, times the billing factor, equals the number of therms you have used in the current billing period.\nCustomer Buried Gas Piping - Customers may have underground gas piping that is not maintained by SWG. (Reference Federal\nRegulation 49 CFR Part 192.16) This piping, which is typically located between the gas meter and a building or outdoor gas appliance,\nmay consist of buried steel gas lines. Steel gas lines are subject to the effects of corrosion if they are not maintained, which could\nresult in leakage. Regardless if the pipe is steel or plastic, it is important that underground natural gas piping is periodically monitored\nto identify potential problems that might cause a hazardous condition. Federal regulations encourage customers to employ qualified\nplumbing and heating contractors for all inspections, monitoring, and repairing of customer buried gas piping. Unsafe conditions\ndiscovered must be repaired immediately. For assistance in locating licensed plumbers or contractors, or reviewing relocation,\nreplacement, or maintenance options, call Energy Services at 1-800-654-2765. Remember, call before you dig to locate gas piping in\nadvance, and excavate by hand.\nDelivery Charge Adjustment Provision - The Delivery Charge Adjustment Provision (DCA) limits the amount SWG recovers in\ndelivery charges to the amount authorized. Any differences between the amount authorized and the amount received are adjusted\nannually. The DCA is applicable to residential and Small, Medium, LI and L.2 rate schedules.\nDeposits - If you are an existing customer, your deposit will be credited to your account, with any applicable interest, after continuous\nservice and timely payment of bills in accordance with SWG commission approved rules. If your service has been discontinued, either\nat your request or by SWG, your deposit, plus any applicable interest, will be refunded to you, less the amount of any unpaid bills.\nDisconnection of Service at Customer Request - Please call SWG at least five (5) working days in advance of the date you wish to have\nservice disconnected. If SWG is not notified, service will continue to be billed to the customer of record.\nDOT Safety Surcharge - This charge recovers the cost of government mandated pipeline safety programs.\nElectronic Check Conversion - When a check is provided as payment, SWG is authorized to either use information from the check to\nmake a one-time electronic funds transfer from the account or to process the payment as a check transaction.\nEmergency Service - In case of an emergency or if you smell natural gas, call SWG at 1-877-860-6020, or dial 911. Emergency service\nis also available by calling: Phoenix/Central Arizona 1-800-528-4277, Tucson/Southern Arizona 1-800-722-4277 or, Bullhead City,\nParker, and Ehrenberg 1-800-447-5422.\nLow Income Residential Discount - Provides a 30 percent discount to income-qualified customers. This is applied to the first 150\ntherms of natural gas used each month from November 1 through April 30.\nNotice to Employers - Request a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for natural gas by calling Energy Services at 1-800-654-2765 or visiting\nwww.swgas.com/emergencysafety. Please ensure your employees know how to obtain SDS information.\nPast Due Date/Late Pay Charge - The monthly bill is due and payable upon presentation and becomes past due if not paid by the \"Past\nDue After\" date on the bill. A late pay charge may be added to any past due amount.\nRates and Other Information - The Rules and Rate Schedules of SWG are available at your nearest SWG Customer Business Office\nor by going online at www.swgas.com. The address and telephone number of the office that serves you are printed on the front of this\nbill (top).\nRight of Access and Bill Estimation - SWG will have the right of access to your premises for any purpose normally connected with\nthe furnishing of natural gas service(s). If SWG is unable to read a meter on the scheduled date because of circumstances beyond its\ncontrol, SWG will calculate the bill based upon estimated usage for that billing period.\nService Establishment and Reestablishment Charge - For each establishment of service there is a charge which appears on the first\nbill following the establishment of service. This charge partially covers the costs incurred to set up the service and create the account in\nthe SWG billing system. Whenever gas service is turned off because of nonpayment, the delinquent bill, plus a reestablishment charge,\nmust be paid and credit reestablished before service will be restored.\nSpecial Services - Every effort will be made to ensure uninterrupted service to residential customers who notify SWG about permanent\nresidents in their household who are seriously ill, disabled, or elderly. Also, in an effort to avoid service being turned off; any residential\ncustomer may elect to designate a third party (agency or individual) to receive a copy of all Disconnect Notices.\nUsage Charge - Usage charges recover the cost of delivering natural gas, which is not recovered in the Basic Service Charge, and the\ncost of natural gas purchased by SWG on behalf of our customers.\ny19.m03,vl\nShould you believe you have been billed incorrectly, please contact SWG at our toll-free number (llamada gratis) 1-877-860-6020.\nIf you thereafter wish to dispute this bill, you should pay the undisputed portion of the bill and notify SWG that the amount\nunpaid is in dispute. Service will be continued pending investigation by SWG. Upon notification by SWG of its investigation\nresults, you may pay the amount due within five (5) working days to prevent discontinuance of service.
